# css-frameworks-ca

This is the first time working with bootstrapp. I found it easy to get to undestand how bootstrapp works, the css was easier to apply and the results are good with less efford. 

# Built With:
  -HTML;
  -SCSS;
  -Bootstrap;


# My project: 

Clone and open repository: https://github.com/AnaCascante/2023-09-03_CSS_Frameworks_CA_Ana-Cascante_Repo.git


# starting the project- what has been done. 


I have used the right alined base nav for the project. 

# index.html site 

Here I use the first exemple on the forms-overview- and I changed the password part with the form text from form control - to be able to get the possibility to have some criteria for the password. I combined a form with a card to give it a better look. 

# in the profile/index.html site 

I used rows and col to position the cards. I did customize the style and the size of the cards and images. 


# in the feed/index.html site

components- badge- headings--- to put the name of the person that owns the feed. 
Customized picture and carousell

# snipper code to make rows and col that I could copy-passet to the project- doing the necessary changes. This is a code that I adjusted myself to fit the necessities of my project. 

     <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center text-center col-sm-12 col-md-6">col one</div>
        <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center text-center col-sm-12 col-md-6">col two</div>
      </div>
     </div>

     <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="row justify-content-center align-items-center text-center col">col one</div>
      </div>
     </div>
